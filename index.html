        <!-- SEO Techniques -->
        <p>One effective SEO technique is keyword optimization. Using relevant and well-researched keywords in titles, headings, and content helps search engines understand the focus of a webpage improving its ranking. Keywords increase visibility and drive more organic traffic to the site (Makosiewicz, 2023).</p>
        <p>Another technique is improving website speed. Fast-loading websites offer a better user experience, which reduces bounce rates and positively impacts search engine rankings. For instance, Google's algorithm favors websites with quicker load times (McCormick, 2024).</p>
        <p>Additionally, creating quality backlinks is essential for SEO. Backlinks from authoritative websites act as endorsements, signaling credibility and relevance to search engines. This technique improves domain authority and search engine rankings (Makosiewicz, 2023).</p>

        <!-- SMO Techniques -->
        <p>Incorporating a "Facebook Like" button on a webpage enhances user engagement. This simple feature enables users to share content with their networks effortlessly, increasing brand visibility and traffic from social media platforms (Eclincher, 2024).</p>
        <p>Using Instagram for social media optimization (SMO) is highly effective. Adding links to your Instagram profile or embedding Instagram posts on your webpage can boost credibility and allow users to connect with your brand visually, fostering trust and loyalty (Kinex, 2014).</p>
        <p>Another SMO technique is integrating social sharing buttons for platforms like Twitter. These buttons encourage visitors to share content instantly, expanding the content's reach and improving overall online presence (Hootsuite Blog, 2022).</p>
